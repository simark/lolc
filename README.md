lolc
====

This was a project for course [INF6302](http://www.polymtl.ca/etudes/cours/details.php?sigle=INF6302) at EPM. The original objective was to write a lolcode to PHP converter to be able to execute lolcode programs. I also wrote an interpreter to execute programs directly instead of using conversion. Both the converter and interpreter are in Java. The grammar is written using JavaCC.
